<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The Engine 11 is a game about the alternative dark future of Earth after global warming.</p>
<p>Despite all the humanity efforts, the temperature kept rising and so did the ocean level. The first century seemed like fun, catching a gondola instead of a taxi and fishing from your balcony, isn`t it a dream? But the reality was, the future of humanity was at the bottom of the ocean and the ocean was getting deeper and deeper every day</p>  
<p>2401 AD, the dry land shrunk to the size of China, the population went up to 13bn and everyone started feeling insecure. Most of the remaining countries created unions in order not to be eaten by hungry neighbors. There were 195 countries in 2050 now it`s 8. Well, at least kids are happy, there is not much geography to learn at school now. There also were some positive aspects. We eventually found out how to control thermonuclear energy same as on Sun and now every city has its own star. It`s a big trend right now btw, every city is named after stars and constellations, I myself happened to be from Methuselah, named in honor of the oldest star in the universe.</p>
<p>The first conflict broke between Oceania and Indo-Arabia. I think the reason was a small volcanic island size of tennis court created by recent volcanic eruption,a really juicy piece of land as you might guess. Soon after, everyone was involved in this chaos and humanity finally plunged into darkness expecting to be eaten by the anglerfish of war. </p>
<p>You`re going to be playing as a pilot of The Engine 11, the mech working on fusion energy. It`s a highly sophisticated technology which requires to be neuro connected to pilot in order to reach maximum battle efficiency. Even though you`re only one unit on the battlefield, you`ll get the power to break lines and stop furious offensives. Just listen to your "Engine", it`ll help you find the way.</p>
<p>So far, there are three main locations: <strong>The Desert</strong> (Mainly old Africa territories recolonized by Indo-Arabia and EUSR - remaining Europian powers with Ukraine and Russia), <strong>Factoria polis</strong>(a huge city made of infinite factories as far as you can see. "Everything the light touches" is covered in mud and oil from factories that create all sorts of war crafts, besides, there is no Sunlight because of 10 km thick smog clouds), <strong>Spiers city</strong>( old Dubai city, the main part of which is under the water, so you can only see Spiers of some skyscrapers</p>
<p> the Main purpose of the game is not to win the war though, but not to lose yourself</p>

<strong>Gameplay</strong>

You'll be playing as a Mech with the ability to Fly as there is plenty of open ocean areas with occasional abandoned skyscrapers. The Engine will have an arsenal of different weapons that will allow you to deal with all sorts of units like infantry, tanks, fighters, etc. But don't think that you'll be just flying and melting all the units around (yes, you'll have a weapon that allows to melt and cut huge ships). Since your mech is one of the most advanced weapons, you'll be helping with undermining countries war economy by snicking into Factoria polis and destroying strategic objects. You'll be ambushing enemies fleet by hiding in Burj Khalifa abandoned floors. But whether it's going to be stealth tactics or hummer tactics, it's only your choice.

<strong>Game specifics</strong>
<p>This game is meant to be pretty moody with rainy and cloudy weather. Imagine furious storms and thousands of lightning in the open ocean where huge 40 meters waves are crushing on remaining structures from the past. You'll often find yourself in a blood bath created by your own mech which will eventually change your hero.</p>

<h2>ABOUT US</h2> 
<p>We`re a team of two: concept and 3d / VFX artists. We`re all into geeky stuff and our dream is to give this world another story like Star Wars or perhaps World of Tolkien's Middle-earth with its unique languages, traditions and profound story.</p>

<p>We feel this idea is worth people's attention but everything that we can currently do is creating a visual part of the game. So, we decided to run a Fundraising NFT campaign exclusively on Litho and try to get some money in order to start developing the actual game and build the community around it.</p>
<p>Our plan is to create a collection with small Mech animations from different game locations.  We`ve already started creating the 3d models in order to speed up scene compositing for the NFT project</p>
