<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The Engine 11 is a game about the alternative durk future of Earth after global worming.</p>
<p>Despite all the humatity afforst the temperature kept risign and so did ocean level. Fist century it seemed like fun, catching gandola instead of taxi and fishing from your balcony isn`t it a dream. But the reality was that the future of humanity was in buttom of the ocean and ocean was getting deeper and deeper every day</p>  
<p>2401 AD the dry land shrunk to the size of China, population went up to 13bn and everyone started feeling insecure. Most of remaining countries created unions in order not to be eaten by hungry neigbours. There were 195 countries in 2050 now it`s 8. Well, at least kids are happy, there is not much of geograhy to learn at school now. There anso were some positive aspects. We eventually found out how to controll thermonuclear energy same as on Sun and now every city has it`s own star. It`s a big trend right now btw, every citi is named like stars and constellations, I myself happened to be from Methuselah it`s named in honor of the oldest star in the universe.</p>
<p>The first conflict broke berween Oceania and Indo-arabia I think the reason was a small volcatic iscland size of tenis court created by recent volcanic arruption, really jusy piece of land as you might guess. Soon after everyone was involved in this chaos and humanity finally plunged into darkness expecting to be eaten by The anglerfish of war. </p>
<p>You`re going to be playing as a pilot of The Engine 11 the mech working on fusion energy. It`s highly suphisticated technology and reqiures to be neuro connected to pilot in order to rich maximum battle efficiency. Even thought you`re only one unit on the battlefield you`ll get the power to break lines and stop furious offensives just listen to your "Engine" it`ll help you to find the way.</p>
<p>So far, there is three main locations: <strong>The Desert</strong> (Mainly old Africa territories recolonised by Indo-arabia and EUSR - remaining europian powers with Ukrain and Russia), <strong>Factoria polis</strong>(Huge city made of infinet factiries as far as you can see and "everything the light touches" is covered in mud and oil from factories that creat all sorts of war craft, besides, there is no Sunlight because of 10 km thick smog clouds), <strong>Spikes city</strong>( old Dubai city the main part of which is under the water, so you can only see Spikes of some skyscrapers</p>
<p>Main purpose of the game is not to with the war though, but to not loos yourself</p>
